BACKGROUND:
CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009 - A Hardware M.I.D.I. Interface Program Pak Cartridge for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1, 2 and 3, including clones and compatibles (Tano Dragon 64, Dragon Data D32, D64 and D200, Tandy Data Products TDP-100, etcetera) by "Little" John Eric Turner and his father "Big" John Robert (J.R.) Turner. Copyright 09 March 2009. Originally released as Open-Source Hardware on March 9, 2009.

Note that the original design is crap, however, a debugged version is forthcoming from "Uncle" Robert "The R.A.T." Allen Turner.

CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009 has been updated to CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R1-03.09.2009 by R.A. Turner on May 21, 2019, just over ten years after the initial release of Version 1, Revision 0.

DESCRIPTION:
This project is an updated version of the "CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009", a hardware MIDI Interface Card for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1,2 and 3, Dragon Data Dragon D32, D64 and D200, Tandy Data Products TDP-100, Tano Dragon 64 and other clones and compatibles. The original "CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009" was designed by my nephew, "Little John", on March 8-9, 2009 as a learning excercise. He was teaching himself to use E.A.G.L.E. in order to design products for the TRS-80 Color Computer line of computers, with the help of his father, my brother, "Big John" or "J.R." as he is known to me. The "CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R0-03.09.2009" was among his very first (learning the art of circuit design) works. It is a terrible design only because he knew nothing about circuit design at the time and it does not appear that his father, "Big John" (J.R.) offered any input in regards to this particular design.

I, "Uncle" Robert "The R.A.T." Allen Turner, have decided to polish up the design a bit and lay out a manufacturable Printed Circuit Board which I will release under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License. This version will be called: "CC-FlexiMIDI-V1R1-03.09.2009"
